--making a factorial function

fact 0 = 1 -- if statement to state that if 0 is inputted we'll output 1

--define a function that takes an integer and doubles it.

-- Using your answer to the previous question, define a function which multiplies its input by 4
multiplyBy4 x = x * 4

--Define a function that takes two inputs and subtracts the smaller one from the bigger one.
--Note: you might want to use an if expression (although you could also use the abs function).

-- Define a function xor taking two boolean inputs which computes the exclusive OR function.

-- Write a recursive function upTo :: Integer -> Integer which computes the sum from 0
--to its input, i.e., where upTo n calculates the sum of n + (n âˆ’ 1) + ... + 1 + 0.
--For example, upTo 5 should equal 15.
--Hint: The shape of this code is very similar to the factorial function we defined in Lecture 2.
